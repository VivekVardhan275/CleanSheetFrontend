## üöÄ Overview

DataCleanr is a modern web application designed to dramatically simplify the data preprocessing workflow. It provides a user-friendly interface to upload, clean, and analyze datasets, bridging the gap between raw data and machine learning-ready formats. Whether you're a data scientist, analyst, or student, DataCleanr empowers you to bypass tedious cleaning tasks and focus on what truly matters: deriving insights.

The application features both automated and manual cleaning modes, backed by a powerful Python/Flask backend, and delivers a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) report to guide your analysis.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Seamless Data Upload**: Upload `.csv` or `.xlsx` files from your local machine, or directly load data from a public URL.
-   **Interactive Data Preview**: Instantly view a snapshot of your dataset in a clean, scrollable table to understand its structure.
-   **Automated Cleaning**: With a single click, apply a smart, default preprocessing pipeline that handles common data issues.
-   **Manual Control Pipeline**: For advanced users, a multi-step sidebar allows for fine-tuned configuration of cleaning steps:
    -   Column selection (dropping unnecessary features)
    -   Missing value imputation (mean, median, mode, etc.)
    -   Outlier handling
    -   Categorical data encoding (One-Hot, Label)
    -   Numerical feature scaling (Standard Scaler, Min-Max)
-   **Comprehensive EDA Dashboard**: Automatically generate and display a detailed EDA report from `ydata-profiling`, showing key insights like data types, null counts, distributions, and correlations.
-   **Downloadable Assets**: At the end of the workflow, easily download your cleaned dataset and the full HTML EDA report.
